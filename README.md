 Purpose:
	Application using Qt5 for reading a Serial Port and displaying received data.
	To be used for Senior Design project by team Netsol.
	
	The debug/ folder is included which contains the .exe compiled application for
	windows. The dependencies were tracked down and copied to the debug/ folder as 
	well, so the debug/ folder can be copied to other windows machines and the .exe
	should run the application.
	
	System used: Qt5.10.1, Qt Creator on Windows 10 with MinGW 32bit compiler

	A snapshot was taken of the working application reading from an ESP32 board
	connected to COM7 with a Baudrate set at 115200. The snapshot is in the main
	directory and named snapshot.png.
